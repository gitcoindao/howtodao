# How To Work for a DAO

This document covers how to transition to and work for a DAO as well as how to spin up and operate a workstream or subdao within a DAO.

Funding



* How to get funding
    * [link to budget proposal submission process]
    * Budget should focus on reward amount, not USD value
    * Budget should focus on high level of what will be accomplished in what time period with the funding requested
    * Initially may start with 3 month budget and extend that to 6/12+ months in the future once a workstream has set a track record
    * Submitting a proposal to Tally requires someone with 1MM+ votes(tokens)
        * Tally is working on a feature to make this process more achievable by others
        * Fish.vote can do this now apparently
* How to manage funds
    * Gnosis multisig is a good option
    * Generally 2 of 3 signers is a good minimal starting place

Compensation



* Workstream lead/proposer - Should be calculated using the same process as other workstream members and should be able to explain the process used to come up with the pay level
* Full time employees - Can be paid monthly at a consistent rate until no longer working for the DAO/workstream
* Everyone - Working for a DAO is potentially risky (or is at least perceived as such at this point) so adding a premium to pay is reasonable
* Incentive - [info soon to come]
* Pay Timing & Schedule Options
    * Full Time
        * Pay ahead 1 month
        * Pay at end of month
* Pay Calculation
    * At the time of budget creation, # of GTC should be identified for each role
    * A preset period of time should be identified for which re-adjustment of the number of GTC being paid is done (this helps to address issues where the number of tokens is no longer sufficient incentive to complete work)
    * The option to have compensation be made in # of GTC vs variable depending on incentive level is an option
    * Workstreams could set a lower level where incentive is increased in order to protect team members and incentivise them to work for the DAO and continue working for the DAO
* Taxes & Workstream Lead/Member Protection
    * An LLC can be created through which payments are issued from
        * [how to create an LLC]
        * Good to create LLC in Wyoming for DAO
    * US employees should have 1099s filed for them when paid over [?]
    * Services that can assist with 1099s

Benefits



* Can use [Opolis](https://opolis.co/) to do benefits

Questions



* How do we pay people that do work for a workstream (sub DAO of the DAO)?
* How do we convince people to come work for the DAO?
    * How long are projects?
    * Can we guarantee pay for X period of time?
    * How does one get medical coverage while working for a DAO?
* How does one pay themselves or determine how much they should get paid when working for the DAO?
    * Proposal to the DAO?
    * Lump it in with the bigger picture budget?
    * As part of the proposal say how much you will pay yourself then the rest of the budget can be used as necessary?
* How does regular pay work?
* Can we reward workstreams/workers in GTC for hitting milestones?
* How does the DAO handle a workstream or individual not doing what they are supposed to get?
* How can someone working for the DAO finance a home as easily if they were working for a corporation?
* How can I pay someone over the amount that requires a 1099?
* When I receive funding for a grant or workstream, how does that work with my income/taxes? 

Ways to pay



* This gets paid when X happens
* Protocol for what type of funding
    * Outcome based, etcâ€¦
* Contract for each workstream to hold funds and release in some way
    * Ability to ask the DAO to change the way that funding is being released
*
